## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these codes, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., `g++` via MinGW on Windows or GCC on Linux/Mac).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Utshav-saha/Data-Structure-Algorithms.git](https://github.com/Utshav-saha/Data-Structure-Algorithms.git)

2. **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data-Structure-Algorithms
    ```
    **Running a File**

    To compile and run a specific C++ file (e.g., inside the Graph folder):
    ```bash
    cd Graph
    g++ filename.cpp -o output
    ./output

### 🤝 Contributing
